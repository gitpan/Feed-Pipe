Revision history for Feed-Pipe

1.003   2009-12-29
        - Entries now get a source element injected when they are added
          to the pipe. This is only marginally useful for non-atom feeds,
          but should allow tracing an entry back to its original source.
        - The source feature requires upgrading to XML::Atom 0.37 to fix
          an Atom bug.
        
1.002   2009-12-04
        - RT 52449: Errant Build.PL script was not up to date. Removed.
          Only Module::Install is supported in this version.
        - Corrected README install instructions.
        - Fixed spurious test failures due to undeclared prerequisites
          in the test scripts.
